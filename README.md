Project: Light Bulb Toggle Effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
In this project, I built a simple interactive light bulb toggle effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a visual effect where a bulb "lights up" when a switch is clicked. Here are the key features:

HTML Structure: Contains the basic elements like the bulb, switch, and wire.

CSS Flexbox: Used to center the elements on the screen and style the bulb, switch, and container.

JavaScript Interactivity: Added functionality using JavaScript to toggle the light bulb on and off by adding/removing the on class.

FontAwesome Icons: Included for the lightbulb and switch icons.

How it works:

The switch is initially grey, and the bulb is dark.

On clicking the switch, the bulb changes color to a bright yellow, indicating that it's "on," and the switch background also changes to green.

The transition is achieved through the addition of the .on class, which changes the background gradient and bulb color.
